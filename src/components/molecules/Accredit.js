      "I learnt product design, which is everything a business owner does before any product is being launched and while the product is ongoing. The class was simplified to everyoneâ€™s level and was worked around everyone's schedule as well. That made it easy for a working-class person like me to attend. Also, the instructor and academy team were amazing.",

It was more like I was a staff here, everyone here at plural code academy is friendly and the atmosphere is very conducive for learning. My experience on a scale so far is 100%.
